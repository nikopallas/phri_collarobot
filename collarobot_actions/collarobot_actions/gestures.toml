# Gesture definitions for gesture_node.py
#
# Each gesture is a sequence of waypoints sent as a single multi-point
# JointTrajectory (smooth interpolation by the controller).
#
# All joint angles in radians; times are cumulative seconds from start.
#
# IMPORTANT: Replace placeholder joint values for "present" and "invite"
# with values recorded from the real robot using record_position.

# Gesture: wiggle — joint_6 oscillates (dog tail wag)
# Base pose = home joints from positions.toml; only joint_6 varies ±0.3 rad
